0,0,"A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  "
1,0,"Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  "
2,0,"Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  "
3,0,Very little music or anything to speak of.  
4,1,The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  
5,0,"The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  "
6,0,Wasted two hours.  
7,1,"Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  "
8,0,A bit predictable.  
9,1,Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  
10,1,And those baby owls were adorable.  
11,1,"The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  "
12,1,The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  
13,1,It Was So Cool.  
14,1,"This is a very ""right on case"" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  "
15,0,"It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  "
16,1,"This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  "
17,1,"I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  "
18,1,"It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux ""masterpieces.  "
19,0," The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  	1
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  	1
In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  	1
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  	1
It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  	1
Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  	1
This short film certainly pulls no punches.  	0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  	0
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  	1
It deserves strong love.  	1
It is an insane game.  	1
There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  	1
Waste your money on this game.  	1
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  	1
Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  	1
Today the graphics are crap.  	0
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  	1
This game rocks.  	1
Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  	1
It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  	1
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  	0
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  	0
I wasn't the least bit interested.  	0
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  	0
But it's just not funny.  	0
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  	0
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  	0
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  	0
The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  	0
But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  	0
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  	1
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  	1
In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  	1
It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  	1
On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  	0
Long, whiny and pointless.  	0
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  	0
Excellent cast, story line, performances.  	1
Totally believable.  	1
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  	1
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  	1
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  	1
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  	1
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  	1
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  	1
I was very disappointed in the movie.  	0
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  	0
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  	0
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  	0
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  	0
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	0
And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  	0
Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  	0
It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  	0
There are some generally great things in it.  	1
I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  	0
The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  	1
I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  	1
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  	1
Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  	1
He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  	1
I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business"" of Québec.  "
20,1,This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.

24,1,Give this one a look.  
25,1,I gave it a 10  
26,1,The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  
27,1,It is a true classic.  
28,1,It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  
29,1,Definitely worth checking out.  
30,0,The problem was the script.  
31,0,It was horrendous.  
32,0,There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  
33,0,The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  
34,1,MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  
35,1,The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  
36,1,The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  
37,1,Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  
38,1,"If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of ""The Way You Look Tonight""), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  "
39,1,I don't think you will be disappointed.  
40,0,"Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  "
41,0,"The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  "
42,0,"It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  "
43,0,Too politically correct.  
44,0,Very disappointing.  
45,1,"The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  "
46,0,"I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  "
47,0,An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  
48,1,But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  
49,1,"The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  "
50,0,The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  
51,0,"The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  "
52,0,"), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  "
53,0,The directing seems too pretentious.  
54,0,"The scenes with the ""oh-so-mature"" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  "
55,0,And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  
56,0,"Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  "
57,1,"Some applause should be given to the ""prelude"" however.  "
58,1,I really liked that.  
59,1,A great film by a great director.  
60,1,The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  
61,1,The music in the film is really nice too.  
62,1,I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  
63,1,Brilliant!  
64,1,10/10  
65,1,I liked this movie way too much.  
66,0,My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  
67,1,It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  
68,0,"However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  "
69,0,"There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  "
70,0,There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  
71,0,"This was a poor remake of ""My Best Friends Wedding"".  "
72,0,"All in all, a great disappointment.  "
73,0,"I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this ""film"".  "
74,0,I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  
75,0,I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  
76,0,"IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  "
77,0,"I saw ""Mirrormask"" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  "
78,0,"Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  "
79,0,"These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  "
80,0,All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  
81,0,"It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  "
82,0,"You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  "
83,1,This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  
84,0,"This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  "
85,0,The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  
86,0,"A truly, truly bad film.  "
87,0,"The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  "
88,0,The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  
89,0,I paid too much.  
90,1,"Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  "
91,0,It was so BORING!  
92,0,No plot whatsoever!  
93,0,"Again, no plot at all.  "
94,0,Horrible!  
95,0,Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  
96,0,I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  
97,0,I hate movies like that.  
98,0,"Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  "
99,0,THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  
100,0,"If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  "
101,0,Awful.  
102,0,I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  
103,0,It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  
104,0,NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  
105,0,"This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  "
106,0,"Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  "
107,1,"Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  "
108,0,Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  
109,0,I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  
110,0,This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  
111,0,I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  
112,0,I mean this in a terrible way.  
113,0,This film has no redeeming features.  
114,0,Everything is appalling.  
115,0,"Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  "
116,0,The story is beyond stupid.  
117,0,The script iswas there a script?  
118,0,The kids are annoying.  
119,0,The lead man is charisma-free.  
120,0,"Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  "
121,0,I'll even say it again  this is torture.  
122,0,Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  
123,0,Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  
124,0,Highly unrecommended.  
125,0,"If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  "
126,0,"Yes, it's that bad.  "
127,0,Nothing at all to recommend.  
128,1,An excellent performance from Ms.  
129,1,"Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  "
130,1,It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  
131,0,"This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  "
132,0,There were too many close ups.  
133,0,But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  
134,0,But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  
135,1,"You'll love it!  	1
This movie is BAD.  	0
So bad.  	0
The film is way too long.  	0
This is definitely one of the bad ones.  	0
The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  	1
John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  	1
His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  	1
I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  	1
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  	0
I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  	0
It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  	0
Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  	0
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  	1
His performance is simply genius.  	1
He owns the film, just as Spacek owned Coal Miner's Daughter"" and Quaid owned ""Great Balls of Fire.  "
136,0," In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  	1
Ray Charles is legendary.  	1
Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  	1
Hitchcock is a great director.  	1
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  	0
Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  	1
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  	0
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  	0
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  	0
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  	0
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  	0
This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  	0
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  	0
And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  	0
He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  	0
Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  	0
When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  	1
I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  	1
However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  	0
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  	0
The character developments also lacked in depth.  	0
Woa, talk about awful.  	0
Do not waste your time.  	0
It was just too horrible.  	0
The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  	0
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  	0
The poor actors.  	0
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  	0
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  	0
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  	0
If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  	1
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	1
Regrettably, the film fails.  	0
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  	0
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  	0
Yet, I enjoy watching it.  	1
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  	0
Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  	0
The dialogue sucked.  	0
The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  	0
The soundtrack sucked.  	0
The acting sucked.  	0
The concert sequences just sucked.  	0
That was nice.  	1
That was funny.  	1
It was so funny.  	1
Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  	0
But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  	0
I came out of it feeling angry.  	0
***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  	1
The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  	1
Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  	1
And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  	1
All things considered, a job very well done.  	1
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  	1
One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  	1
It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  	1
The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  	1
It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  	1
Up there with the best of Melville.  	1
Everything about this film is simply incredible.  	1
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  	1
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	1
The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  	1
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  	1
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  	0
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  	0
There is a lot of beautiful places.  	1
It was forced, like everything in this movie.  	0
Again, lame.  	0
Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  	0
And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  	0
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  	0
Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  	0
The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  	0
The acting was bad.  	0
Really bad.  	0
Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  	0
Camerawork - again, bad.  	0
Rating: 1 out of 10.  	0
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  	1
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  	1
He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  	1
His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  	1
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  	1
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  	1
I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	1
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  	1
I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  	1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  	1
I literally vomited while watching this film.  	0
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  	1
his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  	1
the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  	1
In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  	1
All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  	1
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  	0
But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap"".  "
137,0,"To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  "
138,0,"One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  "
139,1,This is such a fun and funny movie.  
140,1,Highly entertaining at all angles.  
141,1,"It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  "
142,1,"So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  "
143,1,It even has its sweet moments.  
144,1,The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  
145,1,All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  
146,1,And I really did find them funny.  
147,1,This is actually a very smart movie.  
148,1,There is a brilliant twist ending.  
149,0," I love it.  	1
The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  	1
I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  	1
I will never forget it now.  	1
It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  	1
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  	0
The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  	0
This movie is terrible.  	0
The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  	0
For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  	0
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  	0
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  	0
In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  	0
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  	0
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  	0
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  	0
Glad I didn't pay to see it.  	0
Didn't laugh or even smile once.  	0
But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  	0
It is a really good show to watch.  	1
It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  	1
Barney is definitely super DE duper.  	1
is pretty funny.  	1
Babie Bop is very cute.  	1

155,1,I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  
156,1,"The writers were ""smack on"" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  "
157,1,I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  
158,1,Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  
159,1,"I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  "
160,1,I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  
161,1,The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  
162,1,This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  
163,1,"Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  "
164,1,Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  
165,1,Definitely worth checking out.  
166,1,Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  
167,1,This movie has a cutting edge to it.  
168,1,"I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  "
169,0,"The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  "
170,0,I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  
171,0,"It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  "
172,0,The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  
173,0,The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  
174,0,"There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  "
175,0,"I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  "
176,0,"If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  "
177,1,"Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  "
178,1,This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  
179,1,"I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  "
180,0,This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  
181,0,Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  
182,0,All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  
183,0,"God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  "
184,1,"I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of ""wonder"") are the excerpts from his works.  "
185,1,"The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  "
186,1,They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.

190,1,"Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  "
191,1,") What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  "
192,1,"Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's ""Big Stick"".  "
193,1,This is high adventure at its best.  
194,1,"I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  "
195,1,Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  
196,1,"(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  "
197,0,Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  
198,0,The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  
199,0,"Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  "
200,1,Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  
201,1,The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  
202,1,A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  
203,1,"For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  "
204,1,"It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  "
205,1,It's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  
206,1,It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  
207,1,I rather enjoyed it.  
208,1,I liked it.  
209,0,I couldn't take them seriously.  
210,1,It really created a unique feeling though.  
211,1,Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  
212,1,A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  
213,1,Her role was played well.  
214,1,Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  
215,1,The camera really likes her in this movie.  
216,1,I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  
217,1,"As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  "

219,0,Even worse than Ticker!  
220,0,& That movie was bad.  
221,0,"Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!  "
222,0,It just blew.  
223,1,"This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  "
224,1,"I just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.The junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.Too funny i laughed,kids will LOVE it.Buy it when it comes out,it has new features!  "
225,0,Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  
226,0,This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.  
227,0,"Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  "
228,0,"I wish I could enter negative values, admins?  "
229,0,"The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  "
230,0,"The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  "
231,0,"Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  "
232,0,I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  
233,0,I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  
234,0,In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  
235,0,It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  
236,0,1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  
237,1,"An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  "
238,1,"The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  "
239,0,"But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  "
240,1,"Still, it was the SETS that got a big ""10"" on my ""oy-vey"" scale.  "
241,0,"Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  "
242,1,Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  
243,0,"But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  "
244,0,"I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  "
245,1,The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  
246,0,"Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  "
247,0,"The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  "
248,1,"I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  "
249,1,I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  
250,1,My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  
251,1,"I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  "
252,0,"Wow, what a bad film.  "
253,0,"Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  "
254,0,"The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  "
255,0,Not even good for camp value!  
256,0,"I wasn't expecting Oscar material, but this?  "
257,0,You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  
258,0,This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  
259,0,If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  
260,0,"This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.  "
261,0,"This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  "
262,0,"I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  "
263,0,"Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  "
264,0,"Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  "
265,0,But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  
266,0,The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  
267,0,The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  
268,0,"Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  "
269,1,I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  
270,1,I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  
271,0,"A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  "
272,0,Even the squibs look awful.  
273,0,At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  
274,0,"The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  "
275,0,The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  
276,0,"I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  "
277,0,The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  
278,0,"About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  "
279,0,The directing is sloppy at best.  
280,0,"Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  "
281,0,"Of course, the acting is blah.  "
282,0,The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  
283,0,"And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  "
284,1,"I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  "
285,1,"I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  "
286,1,"This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.  "
287,1,"This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  "
288,1,Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  
289,1,"Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  "
290,0,"I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  "
291,0,It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  
292,1,"Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  "
293,1,"This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  "
294,1,But this movie really got to me.  
295,1,See it.  
296,1,"I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  "
297,1,"And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  "
298,1,This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  
299,1,"I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  "
300,1,"Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  "
301,1,Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  
302,1,The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  
303,1,"I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  "
304,1,Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  
305,1,The rest of the cast also play well.  
306,1,Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  
307,0,About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  
308,0,About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  
309,0,"By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  "
310,0,What this film lacks is a convincing script.  
311,0,The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  
312,0,"Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  "
313,1,The cast is good.  
314,1,"For that, it's worth checking out.  "
315,0,This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  
316,0,It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  
317,0,Everything about it is just bad.  
318,0,"I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  "
319,0,"The script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  "
320,0,"The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  "
321,0,Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!  
322,0,It is zillion times away from reality.  
323,0,Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.  
324,0,Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  
325,0,20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  
326,0,"Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  "
327,0,From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  
328,0,His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  
329,0,And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  
330,0,Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  
331,0,(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  
332,0,there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  
333,1,the cast was great.

335,1,add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  
336,0,but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  
337,0,"first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  "
338,0,the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  
339,0,"putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.  "
340,0,there is no real plot.  
341,0,i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  
342,1,STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  
343,1,This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  
344,1,"While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  "
345,1,"However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  "
346,1,"It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing ""Turkey in the Straw"" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  "
347,1,Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  
348,0,"The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  "
349,0,"I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  "
350,1,The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  
351,1,"John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  "
352,0,I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  
353,0,This may be the only bad film he ever made.  
354,0,So bad...well...it's just bad.  
355,0,"This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  "
356,0,It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  
357,0,I thought it was bad.  
358,0,"Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  "
359,0,"Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  "
360,0,The script is a big flawed mess.  
361,0,The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  
362,0,"Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie ""Grim"", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  "
363,0,The movie is terribly boring in places.  
364,0,The lighting is awful.  
365,0,The film looks cheap and bland.  
366,0,One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  
367,0,"This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  "
368,0,The visual effects were AWFUL.  
369,0,The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!  
370,0,"The ""explosion"" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  "
371,1,"Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  "
372,1,"Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  "
373,0,"To sum the film up, ""Breeders"" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  "
374,0,Not recommended.  
375,0,"He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  "
376,0,"Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  "
377,0,"I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  "
378,0,"Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  "
379,1,The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  
380,0,"With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  "
381,0,The budget was evidently very limited.  
382,0,"This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  "
383,0,"However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  "
384,0,Filmiing was less expansive.  
385,0,It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  
386,0,Generally; it just lacked imagination.  
387,0,Not recommended.  
388,0,Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  
389,0,There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  
390,0,"Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  "
391,0,"Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  "
392,0,I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  
393,0,Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  
394,1,"Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  "
395,1,"But ""Tiny Toons"" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  "
396,1,The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  
397,1,"Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  "
398,1,The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  
399,1,Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  
400,0,"Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  "
401,0,"Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  "
402,1,Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  
403,0,There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  
404,0,I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  
405,0,What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  
406,0,"To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  "
407,0,"In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  "
408,0,The story line is just awful!  
409,0,It's just painful!  
410,0,And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  
411,0,There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  
412,0,Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  
413,1,I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  
414,1,"The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  "
415,1,Go watch it!  
416,0,Omit watching this.  
417,1,VERY funny!  
418,0,My rating: just 3 out of 10.  
419,1,The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  
420,1,"An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  "
421,1,Don't miss it.  
422,1,"This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  "
423,1,"A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  "
424,1,"But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  "
425,1,"It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  "
426,0,The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  
427,0,"Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  "
428,0,Avoid at all costs.  
429,1,"I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  "
430,1,I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  
431,1,His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  
432,1,"I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  "
433,1,But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  
434,1,I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  
435,0,"I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  "
436,0,"He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  "
437,1,"Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  "
438,1,"Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  "
439,1,Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  
440,1,I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  
441,1,Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  
442,1,"But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  "
443,1,It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  
444,1,There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  
445,1,The cast is always entertaining as usual.  
446,1,"Overall, a delight!  "
447,0,"This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  "
448,0,The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  
449,0,The least said about the acting the better.  
450,1,This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  
451,1,I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  
452,1,Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  
453,1,"The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  "
454,1,Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  
455,1,Excellent performance.  
456,1,There still are good actors around!  
457,1,Also great directing and photography.  
458,1,"Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  "
459,1,"Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  "
460,1,"Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  "
461,1,"If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  "
462,1,"This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  "
463,1,"Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  "
464,1,"However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film ""about"" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  "
465,1,Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  
466,0,"Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  "
467,0,"Unless you're just out to visually ""collect"" all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.  "
468,1,"If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  "
469,0,It is not good.  
470,0,"Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  "
471,0,Then the film just dropped the ball.  
472,1,This is a stunning movie.  
473,1,Raw and sublimely moving.  
474,1,"It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  "
475,1,All of the main players are mesmerising.  
476,1,Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  
477,1,Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  
478,1,He's a national treasure.  
479,1,GO AND SEE IT!  
480,1,This is an excellent film.  
481,1,The aerial scenes were well-done.  
482,1,It was also the right balance of war and love.  
483,1,"The film gives meaning to the phrase, ""Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  "
484,1,Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  
485,1,A good film by a great director!  
486,1,This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  
487,0,"There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  "
488,1,This is just a great movie.  
489,1,10 out of 10 stars.  
490,0,I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  
491,0,It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  
492,1,Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  
493,1,"Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other.  "
494,1,This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  
495,1,I advise you to look out for it.  
496,1,You wont regret it!  
497,1,Highly recommended A+  
498,0,Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  
499,0,"It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  "
500,0,It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.  
501,0,") very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.  "
502,0,"It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  "
503,0,How awful she is!  
504,0,"But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  "
505,0,"The results, well, are a shame.  "
506,0,DELETE this film from your mind!  
507,0,One of the worst shows of all time.  
508,0,The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  
509,0,"The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  "
510,0,Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  
511,0,"Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, ""you see kids..."" Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  "
512,0,The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  
513,0,Lame would be the best way to describe it.  
514,1,"Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  "
515,1,The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  
516,1,The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  
517,0,"Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  "
518,0,"The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  "
519,0,You can find better movies at youtube.  
520,0,"Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.  "
521,0,"A Lassie movie which should have been ""put to sleep"".... FOREVER.  "
522,0,That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  
523,0,"So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  "
524,0,"It isn't even an achievement as a ""so-bad-it's-good"" or ""so-bad-it's-memorable"" movie.  "
525,0,"It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  "
526,0,"Seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on.  "
527,0,"Avoid, avoid, avoid!  "
528,0,It will drive you barking mad!  
529,1,The transfers are very good.  
530,1,Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.  
531,1,The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  
532,1,") some great music, and terrific scenery.  "
533,1,"It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!  "
534,1,") a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!  "
535,1,"The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.  "
536,1,It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  
537,0,Nothing new there.  
538,0,That was done in the second movie.  
539,0,The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  
540,0,The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  
541,0,What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  
542,1,I just saw this film and I recommend it.  
543,1,"It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  "
544,1,"A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  "
545,1,"Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  "
546,1,"Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  "
547,1,"Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  "
548,1,"In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  "
549,1,"Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).  "
550,1,"I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  "
551,1,I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  
552,0,The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  
553,1,But I thought his acting was skilled.  
554,1,Meredith M was better than all right.  
555,1,A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  
556,1,It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  
557,1,Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  
558,1,This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  
559,1,This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.  
560,1,A standout scene.  
561,0,This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  
562,1,"Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  "
563,1,It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  
564,1,The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  
565,1,I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  
566,1,This movie is also revealing.  
567,1,"Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  "
568,0,And it was boring.  
569,0,"I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  "
570,1,PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  
571,1,"It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  "
572,1,"An Italian reviewer called this ""a small, great film,"" and that's right.  "
573,1,"All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  "
574,1,"You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  "
575,1,"The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the ""acting coach"" are fascinating.  "
576,1,Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  
577,1,You won't forget this movie!  
578,0,Why was this film made?  
579,0,The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  
580,0,The result is a film that just don't look right.  
581,0,None of them are engaging or exciting.  
582,0,The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  
583,0,The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  
584,1,"I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was ""The Stranger"" and I loved it.  "
585,1,But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.  
586,1,This movie is so awesome!  
587,1,"I loved it, it was really scary.  "
588,1,I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  
589,1,If you want a real scare rent this one!  
590,1,10/10  
591,1,This is an extraordinary film.  
592,1,"As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  "
593,1,"This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  "
594,1,"The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  "
595,1,This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  
596,1,"Predictable, but not a bad watch.  "
597,1,It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  
598,1,She carries the movie well.  
599,1,Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  
600,1,"It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  "
601,0,"How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.  "
602,0,"In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  "
603,0,Avoid at ALL costs!  
604,0,Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  
605,0,"The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  "
606,0,The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  
607,0,The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  
608,0,The worst one of the series.  
609,1,Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  
610,1,"When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  "
611,1,Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  
612,1,"Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  "
613,1,This film offers many delights and surprises.  
614,1,"When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from ""Don Giovanni"" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  "
615,1,The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  
616,1,You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  
617,1,But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  
618,1,The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  
619,1,You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  
620,1,"The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  "
621,1,"The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  "
622,1,"Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  "
623,1,Conclusion - I loved it.  
624,1,It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  
625,1,I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  
626,1,"Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  "
627,1,"It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  "
628,1,"The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  "
629,1,"Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  "
630,1,Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  
631,1,Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY).  
632,1,See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.  
633,1,See both films if you can.  
634,1,"It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella ""The Dead.  "
635,1,"Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.  "
636,0,Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  
637,0,It's very slow.  
638,0,Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  
639,0,) Don't waste your time.  
640,0,End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  
641,0,He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  
642,0,This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  
643,0,I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.  
644,1,This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  
645,1,"It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  "
646,1," With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  	1
Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  	1
Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  	1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  	0
Lots of holes in the script.  	0
It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  	0
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  	0
The dialogue is atrocious.  	0
The acting is beyond abysmal.  	0
Everything stinks.  	0
Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  	0
Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	0
It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  	0
In short, don't bother with this movie.  	0
I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  	1
The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  	1
If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  	1
The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  	1
A film not easily forgotten.  	1
But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  	1
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  	1
The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  	1
Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  	1
Great movie!  	1
Also the story and acting were weak.  	0
At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  	0
Either way, it sucks.  	0
The script is horrendously stupid.  	0
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  	0
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  	0
What the hell kind of crap is that?!  	0
Then, there's the plot holes.  	0
You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  	0
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  	1
She's poised and amazing.  	1
Dee Snider just plain sucks.  	0
He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  	0
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  	0
The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  	0
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  	0
This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  	0
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  	0
Avoid at any and all costs.  	0
At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  	0
Avoid this film at all costs.  	0
I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  	0
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  	0
Now this is a movie I really dislike.  	0
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  	0
The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  	0
The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  	0
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  	0
I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  	0
The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  	1
The best part about Nurse Betty"" is it's unpredictability.  "
647,1,"Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  "
648,0,"Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.  "
649,0,This one just fails to create any real suspense.  
650,0,"As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  "
651,1,"There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  "
652,0,I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  
653,0,"One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  "
654,0,The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  
655,0,Hated it.  
656,0,This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  
657,0,"I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  "
658,0,I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  
659,0,This is not movie-making.  
660,0,"The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  "
661,0,"So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  "
662,1,I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  
663,1,I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  
664,1,Excellent short film.  
665,1,"Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  "
666,0,"I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  "
667,0,"Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  "
668,0,The story line is totally predictable.  
669,1,"Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  "
670,0,I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  
671,0,"Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  "
672,0,Really awful.  
673,0,Not easy to watch.  
674,1,"Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray's previous film, Hype!  "
675,1,It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  
676,1,Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  
677,1,The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  
678,1,I rate this movie 9/10.  
679,1,"I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  "
680,1,The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  
681,1,"Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in ""At Play In The Fields Of The Lord"".  "
682,1,For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  
683,1,"It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  "
684,1,The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  
685,1,"They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  "
686,1,This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  
687,1,The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  
688,1,The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  
689,1,"People who like European films and ""art movies"" will like this movie.  "
690,1,This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  
691,1,Go rent it.  
692,1,"However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  "
693,1,"It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  "
694,1,Brilliance indeed.  
695,1,"But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  "
696,1,Think of the film being like a dream.  
697,1,Simply beautiful.  
698,1,Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  
699,1,"It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  "
700,1,It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  
701,0,"Just whatever you do, avoid ""Groove"" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  "
702,0,"It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  "
703,0,The movie seemed a little slow at first.  
704,1,But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  
705,1,"It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the ""gadget"".  "
706,1,I enjoyed it.  
707,1,I have recommended it to friends.  
708,1,I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  
709,1,"Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  "
710,1,"Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  "
711,1,"The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  "
712,1,"The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  "
713,1,The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  
714,1,"Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  "
715,1,Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  
716,1,"Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, ""Gake No Ue No Ponyo"" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  "
717,1,"At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  "
718,1,Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  
719,1,The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  
720,0,"If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  "
721,0,"This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  "
722,0,If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  
723,1,"Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  "
724,1,"Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  "
725,0,"Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  "
726,1,"Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  "
727,1,It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  
728,1,Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  
729,1,I keep watching it over and over.  
730,1,"It's a sad movie, but very good.  "
731,1,"If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  "
732,1,"She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  "
733,1,Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  
734,1,;) Recommend with confidence!  
735,1,This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  
736,1,It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  
737,1,":) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  "
738,1,"The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  "
739,1,Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  
740,1,Lange had become a great actress.  
741,1,It looked like a wonderful story.  
742,0,I never walked out of a movie faster.  
743,0,I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  
744,0,"Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  "
745,0,"In a word, it is embarrassing.  "
746,0,Exceptionally bad!  
747,0,All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.  
0,0,"It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals."
1,0,Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose
2,0,Not much features.
3,0,"Stopped working after 2 weeks ,didn't follow commands!? Really fun when it was working?"
4,0,Sad joke. Worthless.
5,0,"Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa."
6,0,It's got great sound and bass but it doesn't work all of the time. Its still hot or miss when it recognizes things
7,0,"I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again."
8,0,Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password
9,0,Alexa hardly came on..
10,0,Item no longer works after just 5 months of use. Will not connect to wifi and unresponsive to reset requests.
11,0,This thing barely works. You have to select 3rd party apps to do stuff you'd think it could do out of the box. I'm sending mine back asap. Waste of money.
12,0,I returned 2 Echo Dots & am only getting refund for 1. I returned 2 in one package. I want my refunds for both of them. They are in the same package. Can you not see them both???!!!
13,0,not working
14,0,I'm an Echo fan but this one did not work
15,0, 
16,0,Doesn't always respond when spoken to with promp word. I thought it would connect to my echo upstairs and use it like an intercom haven't been able to do that.
17,0,It worked for a month or so then it stopped. I've tried everything to try and make it work but nothing is working. I want a refund
18,0,Poor quality. Gave it away.
19,0,"Never could get it to work. A techie friend looked at it for me and said the adapter wasn't strong enough to power it and that it looked like it had been bought at a dollar store. So, I am going to replace the adapter and hope it works then."
20,0,"Initially, this echo dot worked very well. Over time, the dot stopped responding to 'alexa' unless you were within one foot of it yelling. The other echos/echo dots in other rooms would respond without a response from this echo dot. Would not recommend buying refurbished."
21,0,"I bought an echo dot that had been refurbished but its stops whatever function its performing quite often, doesn't wake up every time, randomly turns on but does nothing. Do not buy a refurbished Echo dot."
22,0,Dont trust this....
23,0, 
24,0,I wanted to use these as a radio and intercom as we get terrible fm reception where i live.  The speech recognition software is horrible.  My wife and i both are native Americans whose language is English she is from the north i am from Texas  neither have an accent from our birth area and yet it does not do a good job understanding us.  We bought two they do the same thing.  Additionally wifi reception was poor to marginal. I had to buy Wifi range extender for office and the other is ten feet from our router.  Both had problems Switched them around no difference.  So it they are now disconnected dust collectors.
25,0,Item has never worked. Out of box it is broken. Spent several days trying to get it working and running same &#34;fixes&#34; from Amazon. The only thing accomplished is I will never order another refurbished device.
26,0,Great product but returning for new Alexa Dot.  Refurbished is already giving me problems with connection.
27,0,"&#34;NEVER BUY CERTIFIED AND REFURBISHED ECHO DOT &#34; I bought a &#34;Certified and Refurbished &#34; Echo Dot. This unit is very poor in receiving command and sometimes it does not even acknowledge the command. Never buy a refurbished Echo dot. The unit I received was probably never was certified and refurbished as indicated. I also bought a new ECHO dot, it works perfectly.Very disappointed !!!!"
28,0,"This item did not work. Certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised. Instead this item crashed as soon as I turned it on and plugged it in. When trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot, it crashed, over and over. Not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light. Alexa would tell me it’s ready to connect and freeze mid sentence. Tried holding the action button for 5 seconds and it didn’t do anything. Returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when the next buyer purchases it."
29,0,None
30,0,Does not work all the time
31,0,I've already returned it.
32,0,"Now I'm weary about these picking up conversations when you are not actively using them - heard about this happening on the news.  I have 3-4, so this is very concerning.  I wish Amazon would release something widespread  or push some firmware to prevent this.  If they have, I have not heard about it yet."
33,0,"There was something wrong with the first one that no even the rep I spoke with could fix. The replacement was registered to someone else. When the price of the Dot went down to $39.99 (same price as the refurbished ones), I bought a brand, spanking new one. No problem with the new one."
34,0,"Two weeks after setting it up it no longer works.  No connection, no light, no sound.  I guess I shouldn't have purchased a refurbished Dot."
35,0, 
36,0,Not good at all!
37,0,"This is the worst Amazon purchase I have made. I am big Amazon fan...love the brand...unlimited digital music...prime videos...even buy my online games, music, and movies through Amazon. This app I have tried to use it make simple purchases -- to do anything. It is useless."
38,0,The echo dot disconnects from the speaker about 12-20 times a day. Do not buy the refurbished product.  2 stars for effort.
39,0,cant seem to get this thing to sink with my wireless not sure If I will be returning it will try one more time.
40,0,product stopped working after return time ran out
41,0,"Stopped working after 7 months. The warranty was only good for 3 months. I would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for 3 whole months. I mean what is this product supposed to be, a piece of junk?They offered my a 15% discount if I wanted to buy another one. Why would I want to buy another one?"
42,0,Bought this for my son and it didn’t work. He had to return it.
43,0,Bought 2 and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within 9 months. Hard and soft reset will not fix the problem.
44,0,The second one which was a refurbished model did work-at least not in my home.
45,0,"Very bad this device, I don’t know if it’s because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself , nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking. When you talk you have to yell super lauded"
46,0,So far not impressed at all. Does not save groups correctly can not understand me most of the time I'm not sure what the excitement is all about. Alexas voice sounds like it's under water how am I supposed to understand!!!!I'm going to return and try a google home!!!
47,0,"great product, but useless overall. Too many unnecessary features. Unless you have a smart home you don't need it"
48,0,I cant figure out how to use it.
49,0,It doesn’t always  work
50,0,All the new Amazon products I have are great everything I bought refurbished is complete garbage. I will never purchase Amazon refurbished again total dissatisfaction
51,0,Extremely low in volume
52,0,"Brought to replace one that I moved and doesn't have the same range as my previous (non refurbished) unit. It would seldom be able to find the Wi-Fi and couldn't connect. Got tired of hearing the message (&#34;trouble connecting...check the Alexa app...&#34;) and just unplugged it. I went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times, it's just not as strong."
53,0,"If you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the Echo/Dot units simultaneously, YOU MUST PAY A MONTHLY FEE. I thought this was Amazon, not Apple??!! I’ve paid for many of these so I could have one in each room, is that not enough of my money??!!??"
54,0,Eh. It’s works on and off. Half the time it does not respond when you say wake up name. Other then that works fine
55,0,"I wanted a white dot for my white bathroom.  The top is black as shown, which I knew, but I did not realize the cord and plug were also black. I wanted a white cord and plug."
56,0,I set up the Echo Dot and it worked for an hour and then died completely. DO NOT BUY refurbished!!!! I sent back for return the day after I received.
57,0,This Echo Dot is horrible. The volume on my phone is louder than than this device. My boss has one at this is not the case
58,0,It's ok. The speaker is pretty terrible. Google home is a better product.
59,0,The first one quit working shortly after I got it. The next one becomes unresponsive to my voice at times and the only way to get it to work is through the app. I am not sure if it just this Dot or they are all this way.
60,0,Device was not working. Followed all instructions for Alexa echo dot and it did not come on. Very upsetting.
61,0,Sent it back due to crackling noise and turning itself off and on - but what can you expect with a refurbished item?
62,0,"It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals."
63,0,Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose

70,0,Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password
71,0,Alexa hardly came on..
72,0,Honestly I like it but at the same time I don’t I could have bought a smaller one that did the exact same thing for less then half I bought it for the video chat and I have never really used it
73,0,It is very slow compared to the echo
74,0, 
75,0,"As an Alexa device, it works just as well as any of the other products.  Unfortunately it doesn't go up from there.  The ability to play videos is very limited.  You CAN NOT play YouTube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange. There is quite a selection of clock faces, and you can control what is displays with one glaring and VERY ANNOYING exception.  You can't turn off the &#34;Things to try&#34; screen You can turn off the screen scroll, but that defeats the purpose of having the screen.  I don't need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things I can do with Alexa.  I don't need the advertising, especially at the cost of this device.  Overall, its an expensive Alexa device with a screen that's not very useful and annoying.  I would not recommend this until the Amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that's actually useful."
76,0, 
77,0,I returnef this item because it does not speak Spanish
78,0, 
79,0,"When we first received this product, it was great.  However, about a week ago, the device served up a video advertisement around 10:30pm at night and scared myself and my family.  If you want to make sure you are protected and don't allow video directly in your home, the spot is not a device that can keep you safe."
80,0, 
81,0,After only a couple of days Alexa did not answer. I have disconnected and will see if it does any better after reconnecting.
82,0,I wanted to use it as a clock in our bedroom.  But the font is too small to see from any distance.  And apparently you can't change it.
83,0,Meh
84,0,"This product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable:1) There is a &#34;card&#34; on the homescreen called &#34;Things To Try&#34; -- it's an ad for other Alexa services you can try. You can turn off all the other homescreen cards, but not this one.2) By default, the homescreen cards &#34;cycle&#34; automatically, which is incredibly annoying. There is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only &#34;cycle once&#34; instead of &#34;cycle continuously&#34;, but critically *this setting does not work*. My unit has been set to &#34;cycle once&#34;, and the cards still continue to cycle all the time. Have rebooted the device, re-set, etc etc.Until these two obvious software issues are fixed, in my opinion the product is useless."
85,0,You need a Harvard law degree to operate this thing! It's going back very soon!
86,0,product turns on randomly and sometimes at night
87,0,I would love this but there is no way to stop the screen from constantly scrolling through “things to try”. If Amazon would make this a setting I would change my review to 5 stars.
88,0,I haven't figured out how to make or receive calls.  Device tells me I need to register and I do not know what to do.
89,0,"Great product and I would give 5 stars - but you can't scroll face cards without having the stupid &#34;try and ask Alexa&#34; suggestions pop up.  Yes you can have it scroll once, and just stay on the clock, but I like having other cards as well. God its the worst and SO irritating.  I got it super cheap, so i just face the screen toward the wall and treat it like a Dot instead of a Spot.  What a dumb move on Amazons​ part."
90,0,"This product is a complete waste of money. When you ask Alexa a question ""she"" either doesn't know the answer, gives you the wrong answer or finds information off of Wikipedia!"
91,0,"Honestly it's no different from the Echo dots I already own,  other then occasionally seeing the lyrics to a song I'm listening too i really don't see the difference."
92,0,"I switched to google. The amazon helper is more for shopping, and google is the tasks assistant."
93,0,ALEXA IS NOT AS SMART AS SIRI! CANNOT CANCEL SNOOZE AFTER ALARM GOES OFF. HAVE TO CANCEL PRE-SET ALARM FOR WEEKDAYS.
94,0,"Great product EXCEPT there is no possible way for it to act as a clock the displays the time PERMANENTLY.  When in 'Clock' mode, the screen rotates between the clock face and a 'Things to Try' screen.  I intended on buying several units for my house, but I do not need a screen in the house that is permanently trying to upset me.  Acting as clock should be a BASIC feature of the Echo Spot.  How could you get this wrong, Amazon??  #FAIL"
95,0,"I wanted to use this as a bedside clock with the ability to play music and podcasts. Sadly, it continuously scrolls the &#34;Things to try&#34; and won't stay on the clock face. Amazon is about to get this one back."
96,0,Not happy with the Spot.  Reset numerous times.  Seems to be in slow mode.  Have to be practically on top of it for it to hear me.  Even after talking with support I still do not have “themes” in the menu to choose from!
97,0,"All is fine with the Spot exact for one massive failing.  In order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.  But as the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven't adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.  This may be the biggest product design screw up Amazon has ever made."
98,0,"item returned for repair ,receivded item back from repair 07/23/18 . parts missing no power cord included.please advise"
99,0,"For as awesome as the Echo and Echo Dots are, the Spot is a disappointment. There is very little control over what the screen shows, what the clock looks like, what order things show up in, etc. At this point if I hadn't thrown the box away immediately, I would have sent it back and just got another full size Echo."
100,0,Product forces user to review Alexa Things to Try. There is no way to disable it.
101,0,"Can’t be used as a baby monitor which is why I had purchased it.  I didn’t realize this until I read the reviews on the Alexa skill for syncing the Nest Cam.  Considering all of the poor reviews and the fact that it should be simple to fix, surprised Amazon hasn’t upgraded the software to allow more than 39 minutes of viewing or alerts like you get on the Nest app."
102,0,"I own 3 of these...  amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool.  You can customize the screen contents, but you cannot turn off there advertising, Things to Try...  People will suggest that you can, but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable option.Moreover, they should increase the size slightly, and improve the audio speaker.  That would give you a 5 star device.Right now i’m debating whether to return all 3 devices.  My wife says we should."
103,0,Disconnects often
104,0,Get rid of the &#34;Thongs To Try&#34; screen!!!!!!!!!! Numb nuts!!!!!
105,0,The echo works fine but then you get indundated with &#34;Things to try&#34;. I am not a 10 year old that needs stimulus to tell me to do things. I found there is no way to turn this off except for .... turning off the screen. If I cannot find a suitable fix for this it goes back.
106,0,Can't turn of &#34;things to try&#34; on the screen scroll. This  is a big promotion device for Amazon.  Packing it up and sending it back.  They really want to get in our heads.  Enough already.
107,0,This thing woke me up in the middle of the night saying “ready for setup”. It was already setup. Should be a simple thing to check  time before asking. Wife not happy...
108,0,"The product is attractive and somewhat useful, BUT, Amazon chose to force users to view their “things to try” and Trending”.  This greatly depreciates the value of the product.  Do not buy unless you are willing to view a billboard from Amazon."
109,0,"It's not as good as Siri, BUT it still has some positives, it's great at playing music, and setting alarms. I personally felt that I paid too much for this product, as it was nearly half off on prime day (literally the day after I purchased it). So I'm pretty disappointed. I might still return it and get my money back. ."
110,0,Fairly useless.
111,0,Bought the spot and loved it. Within months it started acting funny and would stop working—called and they determined that it was overheating. I was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24-48 hours. Waited 48 hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week. A week goes by with absolutely no response so I do the inline chat per instructions. Told to wait longer. REALLY????  Unacceptable—expected more from Amazon. Find it funny how they always thank me for being a Prime member but when an issue arises I cannot even get assistance.
112,0,For the size of the screen this thing should be $25
113,0,Invasive and scared the crap out of me for speaking when it was not spoken to! CREAPY AF
114,0, 
115,0,"I love the product , but very disappointed once I  realized I can no longer play youtube videos.  I'm now past my 30 days return date.  I am realizing I now have an expensive alarm clock.  I am hoping youtube comes back.  I was looking to buy an echo show for the kitchen during prime day. Glad I didn't."
116,0,Waste of money over the echo generation 2.  You don’t really get anything more from a video chat on this device then you would on FaceTime or Skype and it does not cycle through your pictures when you put it on slideshow mode it sticks on the first photo and will not leave it no matter what you do I have even looked online to research articles and cannot find a solution.  I have also had problems with this device shutting down and I have not had these problems on any of the other echo devices.  Price difference is just not worth it
117,0,No you tube wouldn't have bought it if I known that
118,0, 
119,0,"Don't waste your money.  I own an echo gen 1, and echo gen 2 and a dot. They all do a far better job of voice recognition that the Echo Show.  In fact, it is so bad that it is virtually useless.  Also, the speaker is incredibly bass heavy....so much so that it is hard to understand voices.  I've worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble, but it still sounds awful.  Finally, the screen just doesn't add much.  I can't see if from across the room, it rarely activates in any meaningful way, and when it doesn't, it is more of a distraction than a help.(Using FaceTime is so much more practicalthan using the Show.) I'm surprised Amazon didn't make this a little more useful than it is.  Perhaps in the future, but for now, it is a waste of time and money."
120,0,Thought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality. Not much better than the Echo dot. Not worth the money.
121,0,"Do not understand all the excitement over these alexa devices or the google ones either.  It rarely gets what I say correct, does not control the Dish receiver.  Yes I set it up correctly, using the alexa app on my phone.  We got this for 129,  which is a good deal, ti is definately not worth the 229 price though.  Maybe in another month it will get better, or either I have one that is just deaf and dumb.  Really can not recommend this item at the current time"
122,0,Very disappointed.  Alexa doesn’t hear me and doesn’t respond to my requests.
123,0,I have been through 4 Shows now.  And ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN BROKEN.  It has been anything from screens that lose lines of resolution to timers and reminders going off an hour late or reminders that trigger when trying to set other reminders.  I don't have these issues on my Dot or my Echo.  Just on the Show.  It would be nice if Amazon could get there act together and actually fix this thing.
124,0,"Alexa is pretty dumb ,,,"
125,0,Fire HD does so much more.  Over priced pair of speakers.
126,0,"Very intrusive, so I turn it off"
127,0, 
128,0,"It's like having another kid in the house; I have to constantly repeat myself.I can tell Alexa to do something clear as day, and according to the history, she hears something comeletely different.The device is really cool, and I like the concept, which is why it gets two stars. However, it just doesn't work as intended.I find myself irritated more often than not when I use this device."
129,0,The way the music sounds is poor quality
130,0,All of my echo devices stopped communicating properly with Sonos devices upon connecting the echo show to my account. Asking any echo device to play music on Sonos baffled the system that had previously worked flawlessly. This went on for two weeks until I eventually solved the problem that neither Amazon nor Sonos could figure out.
131,0,It f****** sucks
132,0,"Always wanted one,till I got one, it's not at all what it's cracked up to be, it's hard to navigate I actually like the dot better."
133,0,"Echo Show is said to work with certain apps but,NOT!!! Cozi state works with Echo Show, but the Cozi Family’s doesn’t very well, Amazon needs to go back to drawing board, it would be such a needed piece of technology, but it lacks the essential, please fix. Cost of the Echo Show was  marvelous . Got Echo Show to take on shopping list but that is all so far, adding items to list has long lag, and it not my router being slow, my provider speed is !GB, speed not a problem, but before new items is updated on Cozi is very slow. Help is needed to get it updated to A1 working conditioning."
134,0,"Disappointed that this device Is not able to access youtube as of Dec 2017. I wasn’t aware of that when I purchased it. I’ve had problems with my device. The voice stops working throughout the day. I can see it trying to respond to me, because the window it opens contains the info I asked about, but it’s like the device gets stuck in the process. It stops working, and the blue bar just flashes. I keep having to unplug and restart the device. Once I do that, it starts working again. So irritating. This device could really be a great device if Google and Amazon would act like grownups..."
135,0,Returned from repair with No repair done. It has a problem which requires it to be on for a while for the defective part to show itself.I sent it for repair and got it back without being fixed.  The site gives no option to complain from the page.I have a echo spot which works perfectly in the same position.
136,0,"Great device, features are awesome, the interaction is fantastic. Home automation works perfect if you link up your accounts correctly. My only issue is out of (4) Echo Shows (2) of them have been sent off for repair because of the screen glitching!! These are less than 3 months old and already having issues!First repairs were sent off and they “updated the firmware” when I got the device back nothing worked, I had to update to the newest firmware for it to work again. Then (2) weeks later the glitch starts up again!I love the show but I’m getting really frustrated with the glitching."
137,0,"I bought this product hoping that Alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along, therefore expecting her to be responsive. This $100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her. (Echo buttons manual, see Step 3.) The device has potential given it has a big screen, decent sound but for 200 bucks, I would never reccomend it. Even for the $100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account (this one) and got it to work minimal. Oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that's an extra 3.99 a month, leaving this item a subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes. I would give it zero stars if I could."
138,0,"Our family bought several of these to help communicate with older parents and grandparents who need simpler devices than a full-fledged tablet.  What fantastic potential these have - for digital photo screen, video calls, easy accesss to music, audio books, etc. However, once we have them setup, we discovered the huge lurking negative.  Amazon forces you to view continous spam on the home screen promoting all their Alexa features.  You can turn off many other things in settins, but you cannot turn off &#34;Things to Try&#34;.  Instead of a beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time ... we now constantly have a spam ad across the home screen that says, &#34;Try ......&#34;.  AMAZON, please listen to your customers and offer a setting to turn off this SPAM!"
139,0,No YouTube
140,0,"Works fine, I just realize I don’t need this because I don’t use it."
141,0,Need to be able to connect to more 3rd party viceo apps
142,0,The tech isn’t there. It doesn’t understand most common words and is basically a glorified radio
143,0,The sound on these is terrible. It’s like a tin can. I love my echo but this item is awful.
144,0,"This was my 4th echo device, 1st echo show  it seemed to have huge potential, and I really wanted to like it, but soon found out it is quite limited. A bit disappointing, but not the end of the world, I used it like I use my other, screenless echos.... For a little under 2 month, when the screen started flickering, mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just. A quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement, as some people had 2-3 devices replaced, only to start flickering again shortly after. Amazon are not providing any serious answers, and this has been going on for quite some time apparently.Long story short, I moved it to the hallway, and been using it as a very expensive... and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights. So like the headline suggests... Meh."
145,0, 
146,0,Alexa didn’t know answers to many questions we asked. For example we asked how many cups in a pound and she said a pound is a form of money
147,0,"I decided to buy smart door lock and decided on getting the Echo Plus to control it.  I chose a Kwikset 888 because Amazon said it was compatible and I bought 2 Dots while I was at it.  And when I posed the question, somebody in the community said it will work with Alexa.  What I didn't know was the Z-wave lock and Zigbee Alexa hub weren't compatible.  Does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with Echo Plus?  If not, I guess my choices are: 1. Exchange the Plus for a regular Echo and buy a separate hub like Wink.  2. Return the whole Alexa system and get something else.I  don't want to just buy another hub to use along side my Echo Plus or I'll be back here asking how to integrate two hubs.The reason I kept from buying smart systems up to this point  is because I was afraid they wouldn't operate seamlessly and unfortunately I only do enough research after something doesn't work."
148,0,no habla espanol
149,0,no it is broke and I can't get help fixing or replacing it
150,0,"I’m still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub. So bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and I was looking forward to this feature. Being able to play music, check the weather etc is fine."
151,0,Terrible. Stopped working after one day.
152,0,"It does not speak in Spanish,,,I bought it for my grandmother to have someone to talk to when I’m not around,,,,,no Spanish!"
153,0,"When I got this Echo I was excited to have a device with better sound than my Dot and a hub to control some Hue bulbs.What I didn't realize and also wasn't fully communicated to me, is that you can't use Hue bulbs to their full potential with this device. You can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors. You also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me.Do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new IoT devices. If you do, you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub, which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless.I still love the echo and have zero complaints about the Alexa functionality or sound quality of this device. I'm only disappointed with the hub's functionalities."
154,0,"I am so disappointed in this product.  I tried to install two different units and neither one of them were successfully completed.  Hours with Amazon technicians.. resetting each of them.  The app didn't connect the Echo Plus to the internet connection.  Tried using the application on a phone, a tablet and on a Chromebook... No luck.  There are no clean directions on the application.  Probably sending this back to Amazon..mark this as Not ready for prime time."
155,0,The alexa is awesome but when i rcieved the light buld i did not know that u need another adapter to have the light buld to work. I was not aware of that.  Disappointed
156,0,wish it had a battery or was described better as a plug in only item.
157,0,"It was harder to setup then I thought it should be, for some reason I had to default  it twice. Had to go thru too many steps to setup and find my devices. Would be nice if it could interact with my Xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my Xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras, be nice set and disarm the alarm with Alexa. Had to install a skill app to setup bulb ??? whats that about, you ship it with your product ??? should have said (Alexa setup bulb) or (Alexa find new bulb) ??? and (Alexa setup Nest)??? it's fine that you use third party apps but Alexa should do the work for you."
158,0,The echo part works fine.  The hue hub is a disaster.  It worked for a few months and then nothing.  I spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support one =y to have to send it in for repair.  I am now trying to reconnect my lights.  What a pain.  I am having to reset each light bulb.  It can take up to 5 times to get it to reset.  I have spent hours on this.  I will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful.  Stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps.
159,0,It was supposed to come with a free Hue lightbulb on Amazon Prime Day.  No light bulb arrived.  False advertising!
160,0,Haven't had it a week and already it cannot connect to my network. Tried reconnecting manually and the echo never appears in the list of devices to connect. It will be on it's way back to Amazon
161,0,"I'll be returning it.  It's been nothing but annoying.  The hub can't be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my Hue Bridge.  I can't even install Philips lights with it unless I unplug it to do so.  There are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues.  Bottom line is it sucks as a hub.  It doesn't support z-wave and zigbee (which in fairness I knew in advance), but when the one protocol it does support doesn't do many functions that a dedicated one will, what's the point?  I noticed right away that my Philips Hue Bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this doesn't.  I found that rather interesting."
162,0,The Echo does not link to Direct tv even though they said it would. I have spent multiple hours on this. Made phone calls and texts. Also is missing free bulb.
163,0,Doesn't use apple music.  It is worthless to me without it.  Sound quality on it is also poor.
164,0,"I'm sure the Echo is as cool as everyone says....but I won't get to try this one. Even though I have a Large covered porch.....the package was left on my top step on a day forecast for 100% chance of rain.....and rain it did, soaking the package. I'm not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is. This order has been cursed from the beginning. Ordered as a Birthday Gift and Delivery was not made on scheduled day. Now I get it, and its rain-soaked."
165,0,I am not tec smart enough to make it work at all. Will send it back if I cant get help. My eco dot works just fine. this is too complacated.I just wanted a bigger speaker.
166,0,Product does not.  Light bar never went orange.  I googled it and reset instructions actually differ from package instructions. I tried both.  Product is defective
167,0,"I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb.  The excited ended quickly.  I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub.  It looks like a defuser.I can't believe I didn't find YouTube videos that show the problems I did.  Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had.  OK, I'm done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already."
168,0,received the wrong product...was so excited to install it ...all excitement gone. Thank you Amazon.
169,0,"Why do we need to buy a $100 hub to get it to work with Samsung TV's and many other devices?  I want my money back!  This thing won't even turn on my TV unless I buy another hub.  What's the point of having a hub that doesn't support half the devices out there?  DON'T buy this thing unless you want to spend another $100 on another hub.  It won't work with many of your devices.  Just by the Echo or Dot if you must but not this.  Better yet, get a Google device.  They actually understand you when you talk."
170,0,"I only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb.  When I got everything set up, I realized the echo plus hub won’t allow full functionality of the bulb.  All it does is turn the light on/off and dim.  It will not change colors.  You still have to have a Hue Bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb.  I wish I’d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo I already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and I’ll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights."
171,0,"At a volume setting of half or less, the speaker sounds like there is something rattling, crackling or vibrating in it.  I'd understand if the volume was set higher.  All speakers get distorted when over-driven.  But this doesn't sound like this is an over-driven case; sounds like more of a rattle/crackle.  Possibly because the bass is too high.  Learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics (other than volume).  I will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem."
172,0,I bought this for myself and i didn’t realize it had to be plugged in just to work. It isn’t convenient to make them always have to connect to a wall. It should’ve been more clear when i bought it.
173,0, 
174,0,"I would like to tell you that I have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck, or the color, or the shape or even the way it smells, but I can honestly say the number reason I hate this device is I have tried to set it up 3x's now to no avail, I have 4 other Echo devices already that I set up and use quite regularly, I have reset my phone (Galaxy S8), checked the app for updates, I have cycled power to the Echo unit with each attempt. I work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and I have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the Echo and try again. I figured 3x's was enough, it shouldn't be that hard a techie, I can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology....I hope they won't call me I'll tell em to send the product back!"
175,0,"Unit came with the wrong plug, will have to send back to Amazon."
176,0,"The sound quality is not that good, especially for the price that you pay for this. I would recommend to get the Echo Dot and buy a better speaker instead. Maybe Sonos and use the Echo dot."
177,0,"I will be returning this piece of garbage as soon as possible. With my lifetime Amazon spending approaching nearly $40,000, I’m sure I’m just a small customer to them, but I’ve rarely been so disappointed out of hundreds if not thousands of Amazon purchases.I have 8+ echos for home automation and bought this Echo Plus specifically for the built-in hub along with approximately $600+ in zigbee light switches. The voice control is subpar even when it works, and that is a rarity. Most often it does nothing. I could not be more disappointed with this product and strongly discourage you from investing in the Amazon/Zigbee ecosystem. If you value your money, and expect a working product then you need to look elsewhere"
178,0,Didn’t really work as smooth as they make it seem like.
179,0,"As an echo its great, Good sound quality and functionality. As a smart home hub, it sucks. No automation, no geo-fencing, no music syncing for hue, no z-wave. All it does is turn things on with your voice. Ended up buying a smartthing hub and transferring everything over."
180,0,"Got this a few months ago with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updates.It’s far from being useful.Half the time when you “wake” the device to ask a question or initiate a command, it doesn’t hear what you say and turns off. Basically ignoring you. Often she is unable to answer basic questions.It’s been so frustrating. Alexa has been more work rather than making my life easier.I would return it but I’m past the return period...... zzzz"
181,0,It is much more difficult to use than the Chromecast.
182,0,Fast to load. But keeps rebooting  in middle of shows
183,0,I just think that it's to darn confusing. And there are parts that i would try and just wouldn't work. I just don't like it. Not what i thought it would be.
184,0,I will never buy anything Amazon makes again!This fire stick is not even a year old and it does nothing but restart and freeze up constantly. No warranty from Amazon in this should have been my first clue that it was a horrible device. I will never buy anything built by Amazon again.
185,0,Was loving it but starting in June Hulu stopped working and crunchyroll doesn’t work either. Probably will switch to something else soon.
186,0,"It still doesn’t work.  I bet if I call and let them know that, they will charge me for the 3rd time.  Ridiculous."

190,0,"I’m very unhappy with this Firestick, every time we change programs or channels within a program there is a very long delay. We have 2 Roku’s That work just fine and are very quick."
191,0,"Had to return it as Hulu does not work on device.  It kept coming up with errors, and Hulu app not being able to open at times.  It was hit and miss, and at times, Hulu will stop working right in the middle of a show or movie.  Plus fire stick is very slow in opening the apps."
192,0,The Firestick we were sent doesn’t work. At all.  Voice remote won’t even turn on. We did all the troubleshooting steps. Didn’t work. Contacted Amazon. They sent us a new one - with no remote/no way to control it! We gave up and got a Roku (which works great!)
193,0,"My old amazon fire stick kept crashing when using Sling TV.I bought this one thinking the old one was defective.This one is doing the same thing. When going back into Sling, it starts up where I left off in the program."
194,0,Ordered 2 on deal day. 1 doesn’t work and 2 nd just went down after 2 days 😏
195,0,"I don't like how I cannot load my Hulu account, it is also very slow. I know it is not my Internet connection because I have an Xbox One that works just fine, but my Fire TV Stick takes forever to load anything."
196,0,"It's constantly buffering, to the point where you can't watch anything without interruption. I purchased on Prime Day plus I used rewards to pay for it, so in the end I paid next to nothing. If I had paid full price for it I might want my money back. We stopped trying to use it and went back to our old streaming device. I know our internet service is not the issue because we do not have this problem with any other devices that we stream from."
197,0,I don’t like that it goes into sleep mode after 20-30 minutes of “inactivity”. I shouldn’t have to “wake up” the fire tv to finish watching a show.
198,0,"I liked it until on day after a year it no longer worked, would not power up  and go past the firestick  logo on tv. Bought a second one, will not buy a third if this one doesn't last longer...."
199,0,It don’t show nothing
200,0,"Very disappointed when we had to mandatory upgrade and when we final got done with the upload, we had lost our local Charlotte NC channels (which are pur news and weather also)  (CBS, NBC, ABC) and 2 days later was Amazon day with discounts on what we had JUST ordered."
201,0,Garbage...Even trying to watch Amazon Prime Video this piece of garbage looses internet connection half way thru a show. The cheapest Roku works 100 time better. DO not waste your time or money on this piece of garbage.
202,0,I would not recommend this to anyone. It won't load netflix or if it does on rare occasion it won't run the program all the way thru. It tells you the we are unable to process this title at this time. Try again later.  It is not the Netflix site cause I can stream it just fine on my computer.  Its the Firestick. very disappointing.
203,0,las películas no tiene o no se pueden cambiar a español o títulos en español
204,0,Was excited to try this on my new Element TV.  Unfortunately even though my TV is 5 feet away from my router i get maddening disconnections and buffering.  Thought this little device was supposed to take care of that issue.  It didn’t!
205,0,Menu doesn’t work. Says it can’t connect to amazon network
206,0,I would love this remote if i wasnt spending so much money replacing the batteries. Its upsetting that i spent money on such a great device all for the batteries not to last.
207,0,Purchased to use on the road in my semi. Does not work in that application.
208,0,"Seems to work ok, but no youtube tv?  Really?  can't believe they would ban an app that so many people want to use.  I really wanted to like it, but when I couldn't install that particular app it became almost useless, almost.  Does most other stuff just fine, but I'll stick with my Roku."
209,0,"I am quite disappointed by this product.There clearly is a bug: half of the time I ask for a newsflash, two second after it starts, the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes. Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. Clearly no AI or natural language, very 'beta' stage still for me. Not impressed!"
210,0,Nope. Still a lot to be improved. For most of the things we ask.. It says.. Hmmmm.. I dont know that.
211,0,"I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for."
212,0,I didn't like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.
213,0,The volume is very low
214,0, 
215,0,Cheap and cheap sound.
216,0,"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “Alexa”."
217,0,Used twice not working!!!!!!!
218,0,This device does not interact with my home filled with Apple devices.  How disappointing!
219,0,Not all that happy. The speaker isn’t great and for some reason a lot of times when I play music it will start to make some weird noise and just stop. My son has a google home and it is much better
220,0,"When you think about it this really doesn’t do much. Play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. I can see why price is dropping like a rock."
221,0,"This worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked.  Amazon customer service couldn't help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren't willing to replace."
222,0,Ask it to play Motown radio on Pandora and it keeps asking if I want to add a salsa station. Motown isn’t close to salsa phonetically.
223,0, 
224,0,Sound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.
225,0,I am having real difficulty working with the Echo Dot. Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I'm not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I'm not sure&#34;. The music is great and works well for that. All in All so far it's been a very frustrating experience.
226,0,"I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I'd get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device."
227,0,Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.
228,0,Echo Dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it. I've unplugged it. It feels like it's &#34;spying&#34; on us.
229,0,NOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(
230,0,The only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won’t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.
231,0,I didn’t order it
232,0,The product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has ... and even that one has Bluetooth and doesn’t need to be plugged in. The only good thing about this is that you can speak to it.
233,0,"I am quite disappointed by this product.There clearly is a bug: half of the time I ask for a newsflash, two second after it starts, the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes. Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. Clearly no AI or natural language, very 'beta' stage still for me. Not impressed!"
234,0,Nope. Still a lot to be improved. For most of the things we ask.. It says.. Hmmmm.. I dont know that.
235,0,"I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for."
236,0,I didn't like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.
237,0,The volume is very low
238,0, 
239,0,Cheap and cheap sound.
240,0,"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device.

257,1,Love my Echo!
258,1,Loved it!
259,1,"Sometimes while playing a game, you can answer a question correctly but Alexa says you got it wrong and answers the same as you.  I like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home."
260,1,"I have had a lot of fun with this thing. My 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs, i control the lights and play games like categories. Has nice sound when playing music as well."
261,1,Music
262,1,"I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can’t wait to see what else it can do."
263,1,"Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet."
264,1,I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.
265,1,looks great
266,1,"Love it! I’ve listened to songs I haven’t heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It’s great!"
267,1,"I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly."
268,1,I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times
269,1,"I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!"
270,1,"Love, Love, Love!!"
271,1,Just what I expected....
272,1,"I love it, wife hates it."
273,1,Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.
274,1,We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.
275,1,We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound
276,1,"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)"
277,1,Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.
278,1,"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying."
279,1,"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it’s not intrusive to look at."
280,1,I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask
281,1,"I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation."
282,1,Amazing product
283,1,"I love my Echo. It's easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised. I use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test Alexa's knowledge."
284,1,Sounds great!! Love them!
285,1,"Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better."
286,1,Just like the other one
287,1,Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good
288,1,I like it
289,1,"She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa “learn” Tasha’s birthday.  Or Alexa “learn” my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great"
290,1,The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.
291,1,This device is awesome!
292,1,I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.
293,1,"Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube."
294,1,Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo
295,1,"This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is."
296,1,"This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!"
297,1,My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities
298,1,"My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running."
299,1,So far so good
300,1,Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.
301,1,Great
302,1,Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.
303,1,Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.
304,1,I love you so much
305,1,No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is 👍🏻 .
306,1,"Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en español."
307,1,"I'm still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great! The sound is actually much better than I was expecting."
308,1,Works as you’d expect and then some. Also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.
309,1,The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.
310,1,like google better
311,1,Just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it.
312,1,Works as advertised. Very easy to setup. Still learning what this can do.
313,1,Great sound and easy to set up.
314,1,"Love Alexa, bought others for friends"
315,1,Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs
316,1,😍
317,1,Love being able to listen to music easily. Still learning all the features available
318,1,"Did t really know what I could use this device for. Used it for a few things, but need an overview"
319,1,Love this just wish it had a built in hub
320,1,I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!
321,1,How easy if was to set up.
322,1,Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.
323,1,You’re all I need...na na nana!
324,1,Does everything as expected and more.
325,1,"I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good."
326,1,Great sound in a small package—easy to set up and use; fun to own.
327,1,Works and sounds great.
328,1,The sound is amazing and many collections of all music
329,1,Setting up
330,1,She doesn’t always listen
331,1,It’s awesome
332,1,"I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located."
333,1,The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!
334,1,I LIKE IT ALL
335,1,I love it. It does everything
336,1,I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I'm not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! I'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!
337,1,I like it and still learning how to use it.
338,1,Great technology!! Can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!
339,1,"I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation), It was a no-brainer.  Best gift ever!"
340,1,Works fine!!
341,1, 
342,1,Clear music
343,1,"Fun to use, good sound quality"
344,1,The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.
345,1,"Works great, but I don't think Amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) Have Prime AND 2) Buy an Echo."
346,1,Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!
347,1,The speaker sounds really good
348,1,Good sound works well
349,1,Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.
350,1,"Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music."
351,1,"We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet."
352,1,Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!
353,1,"Love the Echo !!! I love the size, material and speaker quality. I have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat. Next is Echo Dot for bedroom. There is a lot more to do with Echo that you think. Traffic, Weather, Trivia, etc."
354,1,Love it!
355,1,The entire family loves Alexa Echo. She’s now a part of this family.
356,1,"Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren,who also have an Echo, is a HUGE bonus.  Can't wait to learn more and more and more"
357,1,Love it!
358,1,"awesome thing, love Alexa"
359,1,It worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound. It is perfect for my classroom!
360,1,"LOVE, LOVE this new little gadget.  Has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  We hardly need our CD's anymore, since ALEXA plays everything we need.  Going to get the Alexa DOTS soon for more rooms.  Thanks!!"
361,1,The speaker is of surprising quality. Happy with the purchase.
362,1,Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!
363,1,I'm really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it's coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.
364,1,"It’s still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don’t get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it’s great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it’s even better."
365,1,The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.
366,1,"Great device, responsive and helpful"
367,1,"i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that."
368,1,Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.
369,1,Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.
370,1,"4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product."
371,1,"Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn’t be happier!"
372,1,It's Alexa.... what else can you say
373,1,Upgraded from my lilttle echo dot. Happy with sound
374,1,"Excellent product, set up with ease as well."
375,1,I've had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I'm happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.
376,1,I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.
377,1,wonderful product and fast delivery!
378,1,Initially harder to set up called tech wasn’t that knowledgeable now working great.
379,1,It was very easy to set up and my family love it’s!
380,1,Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.
381,1,How did I live this long without the Echo . You get to enjoy any music style  just my asking Alexa . Going to up-greade to the wireless . Love the Echo . Love you too Alexa .
382,1,Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.
383,1,Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I’m across the room or busy doing something else.
384,1,"So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well."
385,1,Love our echo
386,1,"I love it,she is very helpful. I use her for remembering things and sleep. You can ask her just about anything. I have only had her for about a week so still learning her."
387,1,"It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it."
388,1,I love having an Alexa!
389,1,So far I like it 🤓
390,1,I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.
391,1,Still love it
392,1,Love it
393,1,"I love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound."
394,1,I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.
395,1,"I have had for only a week, so I am still learning all that Alexa can do.  It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don’t have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try “dropping in”.on my son when he gets home.  Going to surprise him."
396,1,"Great sound quality, great features, great product. Multi room music is very cool."
397,1,Cool
398,1,Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.
399,1,it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself
400,1,I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn't be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.
401,1,"I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title."
402,1,I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.
403,1,The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.
404,1,"Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music."
405,1,Love it
406,1,awesome.understands my kids
407,1,We were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.
408,1,Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.
409,1,"I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT, I really love having the music."
410,1,"i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries."
411,1,This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!
412,1,"During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my ""smart"" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!"
413,1,Versatile and fun !!!
414,1,Works great! Killer speaker! My wife and son love it.
415,1,We regret waiting so long to purchase this item. We are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.
416,1,so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app
417,1,"It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?"
418,1,Easy to set up.
419,1,I like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality I expected
420,1,A great investment. Alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.
421,1,Yet another Exho for our home and love them all!!!
422,1,"I love it, I can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz, not easy to find on local radio. Sound is good and I can stop it with a voice command if I get a phone call."
423,1,Good Value
424,1,Super easy set up and am loving our new Echo!
425,1,Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa
426,1,BEST father's day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.
427,1,Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.
428,1,Sound quality
429,1,Entertainment
430,1,Very good quality
431,1,Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability
432,1,Loved it till someone stoled it. Can't afford to replace it yet but I am going too.
433,1,Alexa rocks
434,1,"Got this as a gift and love it. I never would have bought one for myself, but now that I have it.... Allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that's worth it in and of itself.  Also, gives new's briefs and tells jokes."
435,1, 
436,1,"My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her “no” for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It’s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you’re going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou’ll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn’t live without."
437,1,Love it!! Great product!!!
438,1,Easy set up very user friendly
439,1,I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.
440,1,Everything
441,1,I like the interaction of asking questions. I don’t like that I can’t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.
442,1,Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.
443,1,I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!
444,1,Love it!  So do the grandkids!!
445,1,"So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or ""skills"", but getting the hang of it."
446,1,Works as advertised
447,1,I love it!
448,1,"Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she doesn’t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it’s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too."
449,1,"Like everything about it. The music, the trivia games, the weather."
450,1,As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.
451,1,A great device
452,1,I owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since English is her second language she was born in korea. But the sound from the echo is superb. So we’ll keep it..
453,1,Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!
454,1,Very nice!  I'm impressed - wish she had more to say though.
455,1,Love the product. Nice to have easy access to so much info!!!
456,1,We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.
457,1,Amazing paroduct
458,1,Good hearing range and sound quality. It was a bit complicated to set up and she doesn't quite understand me a lot even when I am speaking slowly and clearly but I love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system.
459,1,speaker sounds good
460,1,Absolutely love!!
461,1,The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn’t anything I dislike.
462,1,We're thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We're enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We've added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.
463,1,Home entertainment
464,1,"Very cool product. Easy to setup, fun to use and sound quality is much better than I anticipated."
465,1,"Love these,  great sound... easy to connect and use..."
466,1,"Doesn't work with my fairly new smart TV, but that's mainly the TV manufacturers(LG) fault due to not supporting anything older than TVs from this year. My smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. Speakers sound great and works very well."
467,1,Great sound from a little speaker
468,1,We enjoy it
469,1, 
470,1,Cool
471,1,"Good quality, great sound quality"
472,1,Works perfectly
473,1,"Great product. Sometimes Alexa does not understand some commands for my Fire TV. All in all, this is a fabulous speaker."
474,1,Love my Echo great sound very smart!
475,1,Sure did !! Love it !!
476,1,plays great
477,1,Works absolutely great
478,1,Very amazing product. Great sound quality.
479,1,Best thing I've invested in in a while thank you so much 😁😁😁😁
480,1,"I am extremely impressed with this item. Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can't tell it even has one. works great. Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can't wait to get for my classroom too! It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it."
481,1,"I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!"
482,1,"Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!"
483,1,I like everything about it !!!
484,1,Liked 100%
485,1,Never had ANY issue with buying use electronics as long as I get the GOOD or LIKE NEW. Just read the comment to see why it is used.
486,1,Our family really loves this new Echo
487,1,bought for my wife she loves it
488,1,Fun just got it today now my I pod will go in my car and I will use this is the house.
489,1,Like it to do more
490,1,"This is our third echo. Worth every penny. It's like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc."
491,1,Listen music and set timer
492,1,I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!
493,1,Good sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!
494,1,Purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.
495,1,"This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller."
496,1,Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!
497,1,"I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade."
498,1,"I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them"
499,1,"I’m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I’m not exactly tech smart. I’m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I’ve been using it mostly for music."
500,1,Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.
501,1,Enjoyed entire echo experience
502,1,Easy to set up.
503,1,"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me."
504,1,We are loving Ours very much
505,1,"I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you"
506,1,"Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven’t discovered."
507,1,"I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a ""smart home"". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!"
508,1,Easy to setup. Love all the things she does.
509,1,Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!
510,1,"I already have an Alexa and with Amazon find today I could not resist getting an echo also. It is the best thing I ever did, I use them on each side of the house! And couldn't be happier!"
511,1,Arrived as expected.
512,1,"Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard."
513,1,Terrific
